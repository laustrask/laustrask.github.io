# I’m Laust Rask Welcome to my personal website!

THIS SITE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

I am a **Master’s Graduate in Nanoscience** from the University of Copenhagen, currently working in the Kurt V. Mikkelsen group.  
My research focuses on **electron transfer through molecular junctions** and **QM/MM simulations**. Currently we are looking into doing QM/XTB simulations of electron transfer processes.

## Research Interests
- Quantum master equations (Liouville-von Neumann, Redfield, Lindblad)  
- Electron transfer in nanoscale systems  
- QM/MM and electrostatics in molecular junctions  
- Density Functional Theory (DFT) and beyond  
- Coupled Cluster methods
- Cluster Perturbation Theory

## Featured Projects
- [Quantum Master Equation Toolbox](#) – Python workflows for simulating open quantum systems  
- [Dalton Automation Scripts](#) – Bash & Python scripts for HPC workflows  
- [Molecular Junction Transport Analysis](#) – QM/MM + Fock matrix reconstruction bridge
