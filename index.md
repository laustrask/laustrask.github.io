# 👋 Hi, I’m Laust Rask

THIS SITE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

I am a **Master’s Graduate in Nanoscience** from the University of Copenhagen, currently working in the Kurt V. Mikkelsen group.  
My research focuses on **electron transfer through molecular junctions** and **QM/MM simulations**. Currently we are looking into doing QM/XTB simulations of electron transfer processes.

- Electron transfer in nanoscale systems  
- QM/MM and electrostatics in molecular junctions  
- Density Functional Theory (DFT) and beyond  
- Coupled Cluster methods
- Cluster Perturbation Theory
