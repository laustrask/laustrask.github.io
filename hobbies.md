## Involvement in KemiRevy
I was an active member of the chemistry revue at the University of Copenhagen called **KemiRevy** from 2022 to 2024. During this time, I contributed to various film projects and helped promote the event, which combines science and entertainment. My film projects can be seen below:
1. The "Sikke et koncept" (what a concept) series - 2023. 
A humorous take on the different study programs at the Department of Chemistry at KU. 
This series includes the following episodes:

A huge thanks to Jerik Lauridsen for his help with the editing and Elias Rangel Aabye and Amalie Skinne for being camera operators.

2. The "Hvad lytter du til?" (What are you listening to?) series - 2024.
A comedic take on the different study programs at the Department of Chemistry at KU.
This is in two parts:
