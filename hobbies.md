## Involvement in KemiRevy {#kemi-revy}
I was an active member of the chemistry revue at the University of Copenhagen called **KemiRevy** from 2022 to 2024. During this time, I contributed to various film projects and helped promote the event, which combines science and entertainment. 

Warning: They are all in Danish and might contain references which are not easily understood without knowledge of the study environment at CHEM KU. Also all the videos are not to be taken seriously, they are just for fun.
